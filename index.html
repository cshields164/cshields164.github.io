   <h1>Charles Shields's Coding Portfolio</h1> <!-- Put your name here -->
  <div>
   <!-- Put a paragraph about yourself here. It doesn't have to be super long. --> 
   <p>This portfolio is focuses on my journey becoming a Data Scientist and Python developer. Here you will find projects targeting data science and software engineering principles.</p>
  <p> My portfolio which focuses on Data Science and my overall experience in coding will be found here: <a href="https://github.com/cshields164">Charles's Github</a> </p>
